# Factorio: Big Iron Chest
A simple mod to solve a simple problem. Unloading one train directly into another without needing to use the slow long handed inserter.

Thanks to 5dim's great collection.
This exports out, and modifies the 2x2 iron chest from 5dim's Transport mod.

It now:
* Is easier to craft (just 4 iron chests, no longer uses plates)
* Only holds 100 items (down from 128)
* Connects to the circuit network (with connector graphics)
* Can be walked between horizontally, as the shadow would suggest. (graphic shifted up and collision box reduced vertically)

I needed an even width chest for a trains only factory, but I didn't need a big set of mods. So I made this. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
