# Factorio: Big Iron Chest
A simple mod to solve a simple problem. Unloading one train directly into another.

Thanks to 5dim's mods.
This exports out, and modifies the 2x2 iron chest from 5dim's Transport mod.

* It is now a bit easier to craft (just 4 iron chests)
* Connectable to the circuit network (with graphics)
* Has had it's picture and collision shifted so you can walk between them horizontally, as the shadow would suggest.
