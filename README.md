# Factorio: Big Iron Chest
A simple mod to solve a simple problem. Unloading one train directly into another.

Thanks to 5dim's mods.
This exports out, and modifies the 2x2 iron chest from 5dim's Transport mod.

It now:
* Is easier to craft (just 4 iron chests, no longer uses plates)
* Only holds 100 items (down from 128)
* Connects to the circuit network (with connector graphics)
* Can be walked between horizontally, as the shadow would suggest. (graphic shifted up and collison box reduced vertically)
